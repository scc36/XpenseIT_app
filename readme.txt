The basic idea of the project is to facilitate the users of the mobile app to track business expenses on their mobile devices and submit them to a central repository for expense processing.

•	Problem Statement
Business trips are a necessary part company function.  However, travelers must compile and report the expenses incurred on those trips.  This task can be time consuming, especially if the traveler is not organized.  The US Travel Association reports 448 million trips for business purposes and each will be marked by several hours of paperwork to log and submit expenses.

•	Statement of Goal:
Our goal is to create a lightweight, user friendly mobile app that allows a person to keep track of their business related expenses while traveling in order to do away with maintaining paper receipts and other expense forms.

The user of the mobile app will be able to track their expenses by taking a picture of their receipt, categorize the expense and enter a total amount as well as any other comments regarding the expense.  To limit the amount of processing done on the mobile device, all of the information will be sent to a central repository. The central repository will store the expense data and may be used to generate reports or feed the other organization’s admin systems.

This is based off Ext JS 3.  It's up to Ext JS 4, so consider changing a few things around
